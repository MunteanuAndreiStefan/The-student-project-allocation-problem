The Student-Project Allocation Problem

 An instance of SPA involves a set of students, projects and teachers. Each teacher offers a unique project having a capacity constraint (an upper bound regarding how many students can be enrolled).
A student may be enrolled in at most one project. Each student has a preferences list over the available projects that he/she finds acceptable, whilst a teacher will normally have preferences over the students that he/she is willing to supervise.

We consider the problem of allocating students to projects based on these preference lists and capacity constraints, the so-called Student-Project 
Implement the Gale-Shapley algorithm to generate a stable matching between students and projects
